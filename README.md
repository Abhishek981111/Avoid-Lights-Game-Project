**Game Concept** :- A survival escape game. Player is in a ghostly labyrinth trying to escape through the maze but to escape through maze player has to find all the keys to be able to finish the level. But all the keys are placed on crypts and being protected by some ghostly entities which wont allow player to escape through the maze. To be able to escape, player must need to collect all the keys and unlock the door.

**Game Features and Implementations** :- 
1. Controlling player movement in all 4 directions, character flip, player health and damage system.
2. Created additional camera follow controls for camera to follow player all the time.
3. Managing all the lighting inside the game using Universal Render Pipeline asset and shadows.
4. Enemy spawning and enemy AI controlling, enemy destruction.
5. Complete game loop including Start, Pause, Restart, Game Over, game Win and other UI.
6. Managing all sounds inside the game using Singleton design pattern such as background music, button clicks, enemy explosions, door, gameover, player death, keys.

**Challenges faced** : 
1. Lighting - Learning to use Universal RP to manage all the lightings inside the game and where to use them was a challenging task.
2. Unity Events system - Use of unity events to subscribe to players death condition and trigger proper game over condition.
3. Design pattern - Used for implementing and managing all the sounds inside the game. Wanted to use for managing the level inside the game but since I wasn't going to make/manage multiple levels so I refused that thought.
